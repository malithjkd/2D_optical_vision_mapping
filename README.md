## Creae image processing methodologes to identify position error in the XY stages

### 1. Introduction

The Bassi gantry system utilizes a single microscopical camera with low magnification to measure X and Y axis position errors simultaneously. The technology is owned by Bassi Systems, but it lacks accuracy.

For this project, our goal is to develop a more precise system and advance technology for PBA. 


### 2. Take images pre-process the image and mark the bounderies.

1. Capture images and save in seperate folder
2. Load images and study forcus enough of not
3. If forcus create bounderies
4. Transfer the bounderies and mark in black and white
5. Mesure the distance it moves using that
   

### 3. Measure the actual distance of the
